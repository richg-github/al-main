                                        <h2>Simple responses versus playbooks</h2>
                                        <p>Automated response includes two main features:&#160;Simple Responses and Playbooks.</p>
                                        <div>
                                            <p>Simple Responses is a core capability in <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Product variable">MDR</span>.  A simple response is an automated action that <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> recommends that you take in response to a common security threat. Simple responses allow you to achieve a security outcome with an interaction between <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> and a third-party device or service that you already have. The "simple"&#160;in simple responses refers to the guided interface that makes it easier to enable even complex response actions. The <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.ALUI_1 variable">Alert Logic console</span> steps you through the setup with a workflow that captures common practices and actions that <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> recommends. No knowledge of programming or automation is required for setup. </p>
                                            <p>Available simple responses cover key use cases for the <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Product variable">MDR</span> platform:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Isolating a host</li>
                                                <li>Disabling a user</li>
                                                <li>Blocking external attacker IP addresses</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>The Playbooks feature is available for organizations that want to go beyond <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> recommendations made available in the core simple responses.  A playbook is a series of automated workflow actions between <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> and your systems that you define. A playbook can also integrate the <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> console with your devices  to achieve a security outcome. However, creating a playbook requires your team to define the logic instead of taking advantage of <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> expertise and a guided interface. A knowledge of programming and workflow automation is helpful for creating playbooks but is not required. Several playbook templates are available to help you get started. </p>
                                        <p><span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> recommends that you start by implementing the simple responses that apply to your environment and devices. Then consider creating a playbook if  your organization has security needs that require different or more complex automation workflows. </p>

                                            <p>On the Simple Responses page, you can add a simple response to take  actions that <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> recommends, using features in the <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.ALUI_1 variable">Alert Logic console</span> and devices or services that you already have. After you choose the security outcome you want to achieve with your device, a guided interface steps you through the process, from connecting your device through choosing a recommended response.</p>

                                            <p>The Simple Response History page lists the run history for all your simple responses. The records include information such as each time the response ran, the start and end time, and the run status.  The history provides an audit trail of all actions taken.</p>
                                            <p>The following table defines the simple response statuses and the action you can perform when the response is in each state.

                                        <p> A playbook is a series of automated workflow actions between <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> and your systems that you define. On the Playbooks page, you can add a playbook and configure it to run automatically in response to triggers, with or without an approval step. You can also run a playbook on a specific incident. <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> provides templates you can use as a starting point to create playbooks for common scenarios.</p>

                                            <p>When there’s a request to cancel or pause the workflow, the task will be in a canceling or pausing state respectively until all action executions in the process of being executed are completed. Once these action executions are completed, the task will go to canceled or paused state respectively. If concurrency for the task is specified and there are remaining items, no new action executions will be requested. When a paused workflow resumes, the task will continue to process any remaining items.</p>

                                            <p>Playbooks based on StackStorm technology, specifically Orquesta workflow [but we don't want to talk about this in the doc]</p>
                                            <p>https://docs.stackstorm.com/workflows.html Orquesta is a new workflow engine, designed specifically for StackStorm, released in 2019. With Orquesta, you can define simple sequential workflows or complex workflows with forks, joins, and sophisticated data transformation and queries.</p>
                                            <p>https://docs.stackstorm.com/orquesta/overview.html:</p>
                                            <p>A workflow definition is a structured YAML file that describes the intent of the workflow. A workflow is made up of one or more tasks. A task defines what action to execute, with what input. When a task completes, it can transition into other tasks based upon criteria. Tasks can also publish output for the next tasks. When there are no more tasks to execute, the workflow is complete.</p>
                                            <p>Orquesta includes a native language spec for the workflow definition. The language spec is decomposed into various models and described with JSON schema. A workflow composer that understands the models converts the workflow definition into a directed graph. The nodes represent the tasks and edges are the task transition. The criteria for task transition is an attribute of the edge. The graph is the underpinning for conducting the workflow execution. The workflow definition is just syntactic sugar.</p>
                                            <p>When there is no more tasks identified to run next, the workflow is complete. On workflow completion, regardless of status, the workflow result contains the list of error(s) if any and the output as defined in the workflow defintion. If the workflow failed, the workflow conductor will do its best to render the output from the latest version of the runtime context at completion of the workflow execution.</p>

                                            <p> "Action metadata is used to describe the action and is defined as YAML. These attributes can be present in the metadata file:</p>
                                            <p>name - Name of the action.</p>
                                            <p>runner_type - The type of runner to execute the action.</p>
                                            <p>enabled - Action cannot be invoked when disabled.</p>
                                            <p>entry_point - Location of the action launch script relative to the /opt/stackstorm/packs/${pack_name}/actions/ directory.</p>
                                            <p>parameters - A dictionary of parameters and optional metadata describing type and default. The metadata is structured data following the JSON Schema specification draft 4. The common parameter types allowed are string, boolean, number (whole numbers and decimal numbers - e.g. 1.0, 1, 3.3333, etc.), object, integer (whole numbers only - 1, 1000, etc.) and array. If metadata is provided, input args are validated on action execution. Otherwise, validation is skipped.</p>
                                            <p>tags - An array with tags for this actions for the purpose of providing supplemental information</p>
