                                        <p>Host discovery determines if a computer or IP address is active. Host discovery scans detect legitimate hosts and determines empty address ranges to avoid unnecessary traffic. The ASV scan solution is for the PCI requirement to perform host discovery which makes a reasonable attempt to identify live systems that include live systems that do not respond to ICMP echo (“ping”) requests.

                                        <p>Backporting involves applying a software patch to an older version of the software than the version it was designed to modify. Backporting is specific to some UNIX/Linux and open source vendors. To learn more, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/backporting" target="_blank">Red Hat about backporting security fixes</a>.</p>
                                        <p data-mc-conditions="Primary.NOTinBHOOF">If you use zero privileged level of network scanning, then <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> scanning provides the option to <a href="../analyze/manage-scans-results.htm#ignoreVulnerability">ignore a vulnerability</a>, which documents the presence of your vendor-supplied patch and suppresses further reporting of this issue on those IP addresses. You can export the list of ignored vulnerabilities as a report to give to other auditors the documented fixes for supposed network vulnerabilities. Network scanners report based on the found version, and auditors expect all vulnerabilities to be enumerated and exceptions to be documented.</p>
                                        <p>The best way to handle backported patches is to do credentialed scans. The preferred method for handling credentialed scans is for <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> to use the OVAL algorithm and data feeds directly from RedHat and other Linux vendors. When you run scans with credentials, the system automatically enumerates the list of installed patches and auto-suppresses vulnerabilities that backported patches addressed. <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> scanning can do this internally and externally from the internet, but it requires standard user access to a Secure Shell (SSH) service on that computer.</p>
                                        <p>When a network vulnerability scanner assesses a computer, it bases some of its findings on found versions of software. If these versions are known to be vulnerable to certain issues, they are enumerated as vulnerable to their respective CVEs. If your vendor backports security fixes and does not update the software version number, you may not be vulnerable despite what the <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> vulnerability report states.</p>

                                        <p>This vulnerability appears in a report when the listed name in the SSL certificate configuration does not match the name used to access the host. This is an automatic failure for external PCI assessment scans due to the inability to verify the legitimacy of the host.</p>
                                        <p>This vulnerability commonly appears when an administrator reuses an SSL certificate from one web application for another. For example, an SSL certificate created for www.mydomain.com cannot be used for mypage.mydomain.com.</p>
                                        <h4>Mitigation</h4>
                                        <p>Use the mitigation methods listed below to address this vulnerability:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>External sites
			<ul><li>Purchase a new SSL certificate created specifically for your web application.</li><li>Use a wildcard SSL certificate for any page on the domain.</li></ul></li>
                                            <li>Internal methods
			<ul><li>Update the reverse DNS record of the IP address to the same subject of the SSL certificate.  The scan automatically detects the reverse DNS name and if it matches the SSL certificate subject, the issue is not flagged.</li><li>Update the SSL Certificate subject line to match the host name of the device.</li></ul></li>
                                            <li>Other methods
			<ul><li>If the scanner is unable to resolve a host name for the host, it is typically related to the configured DNS servers not having a record of the host.</li><li>If the certificate is not valid because it is a generic or default self-signed certificate, you can choose to filter the vulnerability at the IP or job level. If the certificate provides a host name (or lack thereof) that does not match the host name discovered during scanning, this is a valid finding. Filtering this vulnerability is at the discretion of the client only.</li></ul></li>

                                        <p>If the scan result is a false positive, you can make the exposure inactive to remove the results from reports.</p>

                                        <p>In many cases, the SSL&#160;certificate host name discrepancy appears because the host is scanned via an IP&#160;address instead of a fully qualified domain names (FQDN). PCI-DSS requires customers to supply FQDNs in addition to providing all external-facing IP addresses and all other unique entryways into applications for the entire in-scope infrastructure.</p>
                                        <p>If you deploy load balancers, the scan may only see part of the configuration behind the load balancer. In these cases, the following applies:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Localized load balancers: You must supply documentation showing that the infrastructure behind the load balancer(s) is synchronized in terms of configuration.</li>
                                            <li>External load balancing services: Implement a configuration to ensure that all IP addresses and ranges provided are successfully scanned.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>If you believe that a PCI&#160;assessment failure was in error, first verify that the FQDN resolves to the host using an outside source such as <a href="http://www.sslshopper.com/" title="www.sslshopper.com" alt="www.sslshopper.com">www.sslshopper.com</a> or <a href="http://www.digicert.com/help/" title="www.digicert.com/help" alt="www.digicert.com/help">www.digicert.com/help</a>. These sources may also identify other certificate problems.</p>
                                        <p><b>PCI scan disputes</b>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>If the FQDN resolves to the host, you may submit a <a href="../configure/pci-scan-dispute.htm" class="MCXref xref">PCI Scan Disputes</a>. Provide the FQDN in the dispute comment so that <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> can validate the certificate. Enter only one FQDN per host. A single dispute comment containing a blanket statement for all hosts found in the scan is not acceptable. In the case of a load balancer, provide all expected IP resolutions of the FQDN and confirm that hosts behind the load balancer are in sync.</p>
                                        <p>In general, using the FQDN in the scan configuration prevents this vulnerability from appearing.</p>

                                        <h4>Denial-of-service situations</h4>
                                        <p><span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> identifies two scenarios in which active testing can cause a DoS situation on a network.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>Consumption of firewall connections/exhaustion of firewall resources</b>
                                                <br />If an internal  appliance is placed behind a firewall and instructed to scan computers on the other side of the firewall, the appliance can exhaust the available outbound connections/resources of the firewall. This happened on Cisco PIX firewalls where port address translation (PAT) was used to PAT private, internal addresses to the outside interface. During the port scanning phase of the scan, a large number of connections are initiated to identify all open ports on a target device.<br />To avoid this scenario, place the appliance on a segment of the network where it does not have to go through the firewall to reach the target. Then provide a static IP translation for the IP address of the testing unit. This reduces the number of connections the firewall must "remember" during testing.</li>
                                            <li><b>Debug level logging/religious logging</b>
                                                <br />An appliance performing a high level of logging can cause a DoS situation. This happened in both internal and external testing. This scenario is a classic security vulnerability. If a firewall logs every connection attempt to a remote system, it can generate gigabytes of log file traffic, which  causes a strain on network infrastructure and exhausts file system resources of the remote logging console. A strained network infrastructure and exhausted file system resources are known problems with debug-level logging (i.e., logging everything). When a port scan is performed, the number of connections to a device can range from 1,500/3,000 ports connection attempts up to 65,535/131,070 ports connection attempts. To prevent a DoS situation, use a lower level of logging.</li>
