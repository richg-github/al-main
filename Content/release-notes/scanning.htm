Alternatively, if you prefer to manage fewer schedules, you can use your internal network scan schedules for agent-based scans by turning on the <b>Use internal network scan schedules(s)</b> option on the new Agent-Based Scans page.</p>
                                                <p>For customers who had enabled agent-based scans previously, the schedules used depend on your internal network scan schedule configuration:</p>

                                                    <li>If you are using the default internal network scan schedule, <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> uses the default agent-based scan schedule for agent-based scans. <p>If you want to use internal network scan schedules instead, turn on the <b>Use internal network scan schedules(s)</b> option on the Agent-Based Scans page.</p></li>
                                                    <li>If you are using custom internal network scan schedules (not the default), <span class="mc-variable ALVariables.Company variable">Alert Logic</span> uses your internal network scan schedules for your agent-based scans. <p>If you want to use an agent-based scan schedule instead, turn off the <b>Use internal network scan schedules(s)</b> option on the Agent-Based Scans page.
